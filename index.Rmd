## Informatics
Informatics refers to the study , design and application of computer and information systems to solve problems and improve processes in various domains. 
These are some of the aspects covered in informatics;

- Health informatics
- Bioinformatics 
- Data Informatics 
- Clinical informatics
- Cheminformatics 
- Social informatics 
- Business informatics

This course will focus exclusively on Bioinformatics and Chemoinformatics.

### Bioinformatics 
It is the information technology designed to generate and access biological data and derive information from it. 

### Chemoinformatics 
It is the information technology used to design molecular libraries that interact with the identified targets  
<br/>
  
<span style="color: red;">**NOTE:** </span>
Bioinformatics and chemoinformatics are generic terms that encompass the design, creation, organization, management, retrieval, analysis, identification, visualization and use of chemical and biological information.

In this course,it will be used to manage information such as;

- Chemical properties
- Chemical synthesis
- Biological effects 

According to Jurgen B, 2004 defines *Cheminformatics* as the focus ion the information resources needed to optimize of the properties of a ligand to become a drug. It is derived from `Chem-`, `chemi-` or `chemo-informatics`

*Chemical Informatics* is the application of information technology to chemistry(not with a specific focus on drug discovery). 

Frank Brown, 1998 defines Cheminformatics as the mixing of information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge, for the intended purpose of making decisions faster in the arena of drug lead identification and optimization. 

### Application of Chemoinformatics in the Drug Industry
The computer is used to analyze the interactions between the drug and the receptor site and design molecules with an optimal fit. 

Once targets are developed are developed, libraries of compounds are screened for activity with one or more relevant assays using High Throughput Screening. 

**HITS (High Throughput Screening)**  
<br>
The Biochemical target is identified and many compounds are tested on it. The compound with desired effect on the target are selected by HITS. 

HITS is directly used as chemical probe to study the target and it provides the structure for chemists to begin developing a drug or other product. 

Hits are then evaluated for binding, potency, selectivity, and functional activity. 

The researchers then seek to improve the potency of the drug such as;

- Absorption 
- Distribution
- Metabolism
- Excretion
- Toxicity

The potential drug candidates should be in line with Lipinski's Rule of 5, according to Lipinski et al, 1997. These are;

- Have 5 or fewer H-bond(Hydrogen bond) donors (expressed as the sum of OHs and NHs)
- Have a MW less than 500
- LogP less than 5
- Have 10 or less H-bond acceptors (expressed as the sum of Ns and Os)
- Have a number of rotatable bond less than 10


#### Small Molecule
 A small molecule is a low molecular weight organic compound which is by definition not a polymer. In pharmacology, 'small molecule' is usually restricted to a molecule that also binds with high affinity to a biopolymer such as protein, nucleic acid, or polysaccharide and in addition alters the activity or function of biopolymer
 
### Chemical databases
There are many chemical databases, here are some of them;

- Drugbank
- Pubchem
- Zinc

#### The Drug Bank

Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections. Its molecular formula is C16H19N3O5S with a molecular weight of 365.4 g/mol. Amoxicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. It is effective against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Amoxicillin is well-absorbed orally and is stable in gastric acid. It is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Common side effects include gastrointestinal issues and skin rash, with severe allergic reactions being rare but possible. Amoxicillin can interact with drugs like methotrexate and oral contraceptives.

There is more information, this is just but a summary. For more information visit the [DrugBank entry for Amoxicillin](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01060)

#### The PubChem
PubChem is the world's largest collection of freely accessible chemical information. The chemicals are searched by their name, molecular formula, structure, and other identifiers. Find chemical and physical properties, biological activities, safety and toxicity information, patents, literature citations and more. 

This website is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and includes information on chemical compounds, substances and bioassays. 

Bioassay is a scientific method that measures the effect of a substance on living organisms, such as plants, cells, or tissues. 

In this course, we will use the PubChem website to analyze the Aspirin drug. For effective analysis, the following steps will be followed;
