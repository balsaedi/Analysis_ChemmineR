# Analysis of Drug like Molecule using ChemmineR

## ChemmineR Installation

```
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
     install.packages("BiocManager")
 BiocManager::install("ChemmineR")
```

Load the library
```{r}
library("ChemmineR")
```

*ChemmineR* is a chemoinformatics package for analysing drug-like small molecule data in R

## Objectives
The objectives of this project is to;
- predict the physicochemical/structural properties, structural similarity searching, classification and clustering of drug like molecular library.
- to visualize the functions for compound clustering results and chemical structures. 

## Outcome
Learner will able to analyze the drug like small molecule in R

## Informatics
Bioinformatics and Chemoinformatics come from the informatics. 

### Bioinformatics 
It is the information technology designed to generate and access biological data and derive information from it. 

### Chemoinformatics 
It is the information technology used to design molecular libraries that interact with the identified targets 

### Related aspects 
Bioinformatics and chemoinformatics are generic terms that encompass the design, creation, organization, management, retrieval, analysis, diddemination, visualization and use of chemical and biological information. 

IT for managing chemical information and solving chemical problems. 

Chemistry + Information science + Computer Science

Driven by drug recovery research

### Chemoinformatic tasks 
It will be used to manage information such as;

- Chemical properties
- Chemical synthesis
- Biological effects 

According to Jurgen B, 2004 defines *Cheminformatics* as the focus ion the information resources needed to optimize of the properties of a ligand to become a drug. It is derived from `Chem-`, `chemi-` or `chemo-informatics`

*Chemical Informatics* is the application of information technology to chemistry(not with a specific focus on drug discovery). 

Frank Brown, 1998 defines Cheminformatics as the mixing of information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge, for the intended purpose of making decisions faster in the arena of drug lead identification and optimization. 

### Application of Chemoinformatics in the Drug Industry
The computer is used to analyze the interactions between the drug and the receptor site and design molecules with an optimal fit. 

Once targets are developed are developed, libraries of compounds are screened for activity with one or more relevant assays using High Throughput Screening. 

**HITS (High Throughput Screening)**
The Biochemical target is identified and many compounds are tested on it. The compound with desired effect on the target are selected by HITS. 

HITS is directly used as chemical probe to study the target and it provides the structure for chemists to begin developing a drug or other product. 

Hits are then evaluated for binding, potency, selectivity, and functional activity. 

The researchers then seek to improve the potency of the drug such as;

- Absorption 
- Distribution
- Metabolism
- Excretion
- Toxicity

The potential drug candidates should be in line with Lipinski's Rule of 5, according to Lipinski et al, 1997. These are;

- Have 5 or fewer H-bond(Hydrogen bond) donors (expressed as the sum of OHs and NHs)
- Have a MW less than 500
- LogP less than 5
- Have 10 or less H-bond acceptors (expressed as the sum of Ns and Os)
- Have a number of rotatable bond less than 10


There are many chemical databases, here are some of them;

- Drugbank
- Pubchem
- Zinc
- Small molecule DB

#### The Drug Bank
The drug Bank database is a comprehensive freely accessible, online database containing information on drugs and drug targets created and maintained by the University of Alberta and The Metabolomics Innovation Centre located in Alberta, Canada in 2006. 

The homepage of this online database can be accessed anywhere by the link below 

https://www.drugbank.com/

The homepage will show up as below
![drugbank homepage](images/screenshots/drugBank/homepage.png)

The information includes the drug chemical structures, mechanisms of action, interactions, and pharmacological data 

#### The PubChem
PubChem is the world's largest collection of freely accessible chemical information. Search chemicals by name, molecular formula, structure, and other identifiers. Find chemical and physical properties, biological activities, safety and toxicity information, patents, literature citations and more. 

Topics 
  - PubChem depositories

#### Zinc Databases
It is a free database of commercially-available compounds for virtually screening and contains over 230 millions purchasable compounds in ready-to-dock, 3D formats. ZINC also contains over 750 million purchasable compounds. It is provided by Irwin and Shoichet Laboratories in the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). 

This is curated collected of commercially available chemical compounds prepared especially for virtual screening. 

The database contains over 37 million enumerated searchable, commercially available compounds in 2D, over 4.5 billion of which have been built in biologically relevant ready-to-dock 3D formats. The database can be searched online using whole-molecule similarity, substructure, and patterns in 2D

#### Small Molecule DB
 A small molecule is a low molecular weight organic compound which is by definition not a polymer. In pharmacology, 'small molecule' is usually restricted to a molecule that also binds with high affinity to a biopolymer such as protein, nucleic acid, or polysaccharide and in addition alters the activity or function of biopolymer


## Why ChemmineR tool 
`ChemmineR` is a chemoinformatics package for analyzing drug-like small molecule data in R . In addition, `ChemmineR    offers visualization functions for compounds clustering results and chemical structures. 

The integration of chemoinformatics tools with the R programming environment has many advantages, such as aeasy access to a wide spectrum of statistical methods, machine learning algorithms and graphic utilities. 

`ChemmineR` is an online service for analyzing and clustering small molecules by structural similarities, physicochemical properties or custom data types.
