IT for managing chemical information and solving chemical problems. Chemistry + Information science + Computer Science Driven by drug recovery research 1.4.4 Chemoinformatic tasks It will be used to manage information such as; Chemical properties Chemical synthesis Biological effects According to Jurgen B, 2004 defines Cheminformatics as the focus ion the information resources needed to optimize of the properties of a ligand to become a drug. It is derived from Chem-, chemi- or chemo-informatics Chemical Informatics is the application of information technology to chemistry(not with a specific focus on drug discovery). Frank Brown, 1998 defines Cheminformatics as the mixing of information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge, for the intended purpose of making decisions faster in the arena of drug lead identification and optimization. 1.4.5 Application of Chemoinformatics in the Drug Industry The computer is used to analyze the interactions between the drug and the receptor site and design molecules with an optimal fit. Once targets are developed are developed, libraries of compounds are screened for activity with one or more relevant assays using High Throughput Screening. HITS (High Throughput Screening) The Biochemical target is identified and many compounds are tested on it. The compound with desired effect on the target are selected by HITS. HITS is directly used as chemical probe to study the target and it provides the structure for chemists to begin developing a drug or other product. Hits are then evaluated for binding, potency, selectivity, and functional activity. The researchers then seek to improve the potency of the drug such as; Absorption Distribution Metabolism Excretion Toxicity The potential drug candidates should be in line with Lipinski’s Rule of 5, according to Lipinski et al, 1997. These are; Have 5 or fewer H-bond(Hydrogen bond) donors (expressed as the sum of OHs and NHs) Have a MW less than 500 LogP less than 5 Have 10 or less H-bond acceptors (expressed as the sum of Ns and Os) Have a number of rotatable bond less than 10 There are many chemical databases, here are some of them; Drugbank Pubchem Zinc Overview of small molecule database Small molecule DB - A small molecule is a low molecular weight organic compound which is by definition not a polymer. In pharmacology, ‘small molecule’ is usually restricted to a molecule that also binds with high affinity to a biopolymer such as protein, nucleic acid, or polysaccharide and in addition alters the activity or function of biopolymer Drug Bank: The drug Bank database is a comprehensive freely accessible, online database containing information on drugs and drug targets created and maintained by the University of Alberta and The Metabolomics Innovation Centre located in Alberta, Canada in 2006. PubChem: is the world’s largest collection of freely accessible chemical information. Search chemicals by name, molecular formula, structure, and other identifiers. Find chemical and physical properties, biological activities, safety and toxicity information, patents, literature citations and more. ZINC: It is a free database of commercially-available compounds for virtually screening and contains over 230 millions purchasable compounds in ready-to-dock, 3D formats. ZINC also contains over 750 million purchasable compounds. It is provided by Irwin and Shoichet Laboratories in the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). 1.4.5.1 Drug Bank Inteface 1.4.5.2 PubChem Interface Topics - PubChem depositories 1.4.5.3 Zinc Databases This is curated collected of commercially available chemical compounds prepared especially for virtual screening. The database contains over 37 million enumerated searchable, commercially available compounds in 2D, over 4.5 billion of which have been built in biologically relevant ready-to-dock 3D formats. The database can be searched online using whole-molecule similarity, substructure, and patterns in 2D Add how the database works and its interface. How molecules are sketched 1.5 Why ChemmineR tool ChemmineR is a chemoinformatics package for analyzing drug-like small molecule data in R . In addition, `ChemmineR offers visualization functions for compounds clustering results and chemical structures. The integration of chemoinformatics tools with the R programming environment has many advantages, such as aeasy access to a wide spectrum of statistical methods, machine learning algorithms and graphic utilities. ChemmineR is an online service for analyzing and clustering small molecules by structural similarities, physicochemical properties or custom data types. &lt;Check min 1hr 5mins&gt; 1.5.1 Overview of Chemmine web tool Chemmine WEb Tools is an online service for analyzing and clustering small molecules by structural similarities, physicochemical properties or custom data types. Compounds can be imported into the workbench by drawing structures in the web browser, copy and paste, from local files, or from a PubChem search which includes an online molecular editor. &lt;check 1hr 9min&gt; "],["bioconductor-package.html", "Chapter 2 Bioconductor Package", " Chapter 2 Bioconductor Package "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
